            <a href="#" class="blog-title">Beginning of my Journey</a>
            <p>When I was younger, I studied Graphic Design at Haarlem College. Since then, I have wanted to have a career within Web Development so decided to undertake a training course with DMS4All to refresh my existing knowledge. I then started to think about what real-world projects I could create to demonstrate my expertise with using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress. The course would cover the basics of the systems, so I looked at W3 schools to further my understanding and knowledge. I will be looking to create projects including: a Weather App, a Media Player App, a website around my Travel Adventures with my wife, a 3D Portfolio, and a WordPress Portfolio. To start off with, I want to create the website about my Travels as I'd like to give this to my wife ahead of the Easter Weekend in April.</p>
